# Portfolio Optimization using Markowitz Theory and CAPM Estimation

## Objective

The objective of this project is to construct an optimized investment portfolio using Markowitz optimization theory and estimate the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) equation for a selected group of assets. The project aims to maximize returns while managing risk and understanding the relationship between asset returns and systematic risk.

## Description

This project utilizes historical financial data for a portfolio consisting of the following assets:

- INFY.NS
- TCS.NS
- TATAMOTORS.NS
- MARUTI.NS
- SUNPHARMA.NS
- CIPLA.NS
- ITC.NS
- MARICO.NS
- GOLDBEES.NS

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Historical financial data for the selected assets is fetched and preprocessed.

2. **Expected Return Calculation**: The expected returns for each asset are calculated.

3. **Variance-Covariance Matrix Analysis**: The variance-covariance matrix is analyzed to assess the relationships and risks among the assets.

4. **Portfolio Optimization**: Markowitz optimization theory is applied to determine the optimal asset weights, with the goal of maximizing the Sharpe ratio. These weights are calculated automatically.

5. **CAPM Estimation**: The optimized portfolio is used to estimate the CAPM equation, which provides insights into the expected return based on systematic risk.

## Results

Portfolio Weights:
- INFY.NS: 11.67%
- TCS.NS: 11.24%
- TATAMOTORS.NS: 11.83%
- MARUTI.NS: 11.10%
- SUNPHARMA.NS: 11.47%
- CIPLA.NS: 11.25%
- ITC.NS: 11.30%
- MARICO.NS: 11.29%
- GOLDBEES.NS: 8.86%

 Expected Annual Return: 17.9%
 Annual Volatility: 13.5%
 Sharpe Ratio: 1.18

Portfolio Beta: 0.72 (indicating the portfolio's sensitivity to market movements)

Expected Return using CAPM: 1.99%

These results demonstrate that the optimized portfolio offers an attractive risk-adjusted return, with a Sharpe ratio indicating solid performance relative to the risk taken. The CAPM estimation helps investors understand the relationship between the portfolio's expected return and systematic risk in the market.
